1. "The King_Function_Tutorial.html" file is a tutorial I made that explains three sets of functions in the StringR package. The data I used is based on my personal interests. I made this for a Bioinfomatics class that I took during the summer and presented this to my class!

2. The "King_Week7.Rmd" file is my use of if, else, and else if loops in R. This was my favorite homework assignment that I submitted for a Bioinfomatics summer course I took!
